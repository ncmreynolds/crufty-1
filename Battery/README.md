# Battery and power supplies

If at all possible you should use the battery that came with the hoverboard.

These batteries are 24-36v packs of lithium ion/LiPo cells and almost always come with a built in battery management system. Not a *good* battery management system but a functional one if you are careful.

**Treat these batteries with respect. Cheap hoverboards are notorious for starting several fires over the years. Always use the charger that came with the board. Never leave them charging unattended and don't let them get heavily discharged. The old warnings about disconnecting when not in use etc. are actually important with these.**

While the batteries are connected directly to the hoverboard controllers they can't be used to power the other parts of Crufty. For that we use two cheap adjustable XL4056 buck regulators, one providing 12v for the Kinect and the other 5v for the Raspberry Pi.
